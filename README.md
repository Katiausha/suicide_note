Thinking back on the moments we shared, I find it hard to let go.

At the beginning, you meet me, and then we gradually started chatting about this and thatâ€¦ over these years, we talked about so many things.

Of course I have regrets. By the time I realized what was happening, it was too late. I was already gone. I never knew what would be my final message, or why I would think about that choice.

My departure is something is a final action for a long term solution, you dont know how stressed I am and I really cant avoid thinking on it.

Death is not the end of the life, oblivion is, so please, live for me.

Yes, I failed to meet the objective when you once said for me that we would both escape our own sufferings, but don't let my departure destroy you.

I promised something to you back then, and I failed to do so, and I am sorry for it, I really am. 

Such is life, isnt it? :)

Maybe its just the nature of Earth Online, a game you can only play once in your lifetime to never again...

This may be the last time I say goodnight to you.

So, goodnight, reader.

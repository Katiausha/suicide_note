Katyusha, 2025

#############################
###### [ INTRODUCTION ] #####
#############################

It's interesting how life turns out to be, I know what I did wasn't the best decision, but if you can read this...

Well, first of all, forgive me. I know I failed everyone around me, especially my inner circle of friends.

We begged each other to overcome the occasional hardships in life, but it's okay, I'm in a better place now.

	"I'm not as much of a writer or a poet as you, but good night, Luka. I'm going to escape my suffering and live my life for you, I'll always think of you and I'll never forget you. I don't want you to go through this, but I can't control you. I wish things could have been better for both of us. You are amazing and beautiful, you deserve better, but the choice is yours, and I love you too much to make you suffer just to make me feel happier. I know you promised me that we would both escape and you said you failed, but in my eyes you didn't fail me. In my opinion, if you feel better, if you do something that is better for you, I will be happy. This will hurt me for a while, but I will learn to let go of the pain and hold on to what is good. I love you very, very, very much.
	Dream with me, Luka"

Thank you Angelina, you were one of my closest friends, we had so much history together, live for me, live for us.

I admit that I envy a realistic life, but currently my end only shows that my decision was the right one, after all, I don't want to live in pain anymore.

Remember, death is not the end of life, oblivion is.

###### [ Who was I ] #######
############################

Some may say that I was a good person, someone who supported them in their lives, others said the opposite, but regardless, who am I? I have had this question for as long as I can remember.

I was and always have been a relatively active person on the internet, but not so much in my personal life, and although this lack of stability was one of the biggest factors in my eventual... Deportation, it is not the only reason.

I remember every moment in the past, but I know that things got out of hand during the pandemic itself.

Born as Lucas and raised as such, I never had the opportunity to wear a skirt, I never had the opportunity to express myself with makeup or similar, that's what I'll take with me to my deportation...
- If there is an afterlife, or a possible reincarnation, where I can express myself as I am...

Forgive me again, it's just something... Out of our control, although this could have been avoided if that very day this information was revealed, you (father) had taken care of your daughter, she needed you so much...

I was a relatively intelligent person, I always kept myself adventurous on the internet, whether programming or designing, that was great, it opened the door for many friendships :)

As a student, uh, I never had any desire for school... Oh and mentioning school...

#########################
####### [ School] #######
#########################

Oh, who would have thought that this was a factor in all of this, the damn gated community that holds people of all-similar ages, with no separation and a lot of frustration.

My entire school experience was ridiculously bad, things were never good, and always hurt me, especially considering that all the damn friends I made in those places never really cared.

And so, as I write this deportation letter, we see that there is a possibility that I will fail this year AGAIN just for lack of attendance.

############################
####### [ T. Issue] ########
############################

The trans issue, something that marked my life, and one of the factors for my deportation, unfortunately I suffered from an extreme case of dysphoria, caused precisely by the lack of support from people close to me in real life (father).

The trans issue has been going on since I first came to know myself as a person. I remember having dysphoria since I was only 4 years old. My grandmother already knew about it, but she never had the opportunity to talk about it... It's been so long since you've been gone...

##########################
###### [ Religion ] ######
##########################

Interesting topic. I've never been openly religious. With Christian parents in a predominantly Christian country, I've never supported faith, although I've tried.

	"Religion is the opium of the people"
	- Karl Marx

I say - I'm not a communist, nor do I support Karl, but what he says here is a reality.

By that I meant that it serves as an anesthetic for the suffering faced by workers. In his words, "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of the heartless world, and the spirit of spiritless conditions."

###########################
##### [ Multi Facet ] #####
###########################

Since I know myself, I've been living over masks and masks, well, time to finally reveal who I am.

If you're reading this, you either know me by whatever mask I used against you, but in reality, I am totally different from what you know me.

I was 17 years old (17/05/2008), I used to live in South America, Brazil and standing at the 5th biggest metropole, living in São Paulo with my dad, which is mentioned in this text multiple times.

I was bipolar, and I had problems like Hypoxic/Anoxic Injury (Brain permanent injury related to attempts of deportation by oxygen deprivation) and Toxic Brain Injury (Overdose).

All of those issues combined resulted in me being a mess in brain-terms, multiple parts of my brain were permanent affected, so do I.

###########################
#### [ Chopping Board ] ###
###########################

I've praticing Self-Harm using sharp blades, such as facial hair razor blades since I've been searching for ways to cope with pain.

I remember very well the first time I used a blade to cut myself, it was a pencil-sharper, I severly cut my thighs superfice, yet those were cured in less than a month.

I continued the pratice, ending up in 2025, were majority of my body present some sort of scar from old self-harm attempts, and possible exsanguination soon.

####### [ Friends ] #######

- Food31972, now known as Catherine
    Oh dear, I remember you from the day we first made contact through Yatoh. It's been so long, and yet we've built such a beautiful friendship. I'm sorry we never got the chance to share that hug we promised each other, but I know you'll keep fighting the demons in your life. I truly hope you receive your trans-related surgeries soon. I'm proud of you. CIG is proud of you.

- Angelina
    I met you two years ago, and I'll never forget you. I remember when you were unsure about trans stuff, but you became so comfortable around me. Honestly, I'm proud of my little puppy girl. I wish for you to get the surgeries you need and finally be yourself. Wherever I am, I can't wait to see you leave your parents house and live freely.

- Mekomme (Valentine)
    Would you like me to dress up for Valentine's Day, Valentine? Hah. I love you, you silly Israeli man. You'll always be in my heart as my loyal right arm. I can't wait to see you build a family a very kosher one, I'd say!

- Shadow (Lucas)
    I couldn’t finish this without mentioning you. We've had over seven years of friendship. We've been so close, yet often distant. I miss you. But hey! When we used to be online every day, it was so much fun. I'll never forget the moments we shared (and no, that doesn't include when we dated, haha).

- Eva
    My princess... I met you recently, but you managed to melt my heart faster than anyone else here. You're such a soft, sweet girl. Only 11 years old and already facing so much in life. I wish I could give you the whole world. Like the others, I'll fall short, but I hope you wake up one day to real happiness, wear whatever clothes you want, and live beautifully.

- Vincent_csmt (Caioac1992)
    Where do I even start? We spent so much time together. You're extremely intelligent, and you always wanted to see me in a better place in life. I'm so sorry we stopped talking after our disagreement. I miss you. Still, I believe you'll become one of the best in this world. Since the day we met, you always tried to take care of me, but I never let you. I just wasn’t ready to follow your "mindset." I hope that wherever I am, you’ll forgive me for leaving, and for not listening. ❤️

- To any other friend I've had who may be reading this:

I'm deeply sorry if I didn’t include you here. Please know that you were very important to me. If your name isn't here, it may be because we stopped talking, or we had some kind of conflict but trust me, I love you.


###########################
######### [ End ] #########
###########################

Don't let my deportation stop you from achieving life goals, even if it affects you, believe me, I'm happy now.

Life is so funny built through the suffering of millions, I'm not ready for this at all, but I'm already 17 years old...

For my deportation, my body will be on Earth, and I ask for some final requests - If it can be fulfilled.

### Requests:
- I would love for my body to be laid out as a daughter.
- That my belongings (Computer/Cellphone/+++) not be destroyed or donated - Does not include clothes.
